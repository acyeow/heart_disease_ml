# Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

This project focused on developing a robust machine-learning model for heart disease prediction using a large dataset of 440,000 entries. The methodology encompassed rigorous data preprocessing, including data cleaning and categorical variable encoding, followed by in-depth exploratory data analysis to elucidate key risk factors. Advanced feature engineering techniques, such as yeo-johnson and nth-root transformations, were applied to optimize numerical data representation. To mitigate class imbalance, undersampling methods, particularly RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours, were employed. The project evaluated a diverse array of machine learning algorithms, including linear models, support vector machines, tree-based methods, and neural networks. The LGBMClassifier emerged as the superior model following extensive hyperparameter optimization through grid search and cross-validation. The final model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 94% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.47, effectively addressing the challenges posed by the imbalanced nature of the dataset in this critical binary classification task.
